\section{\texttt{histogram}}

	\subsection{All options}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{-d} \textit{delimiter} -- Allows selection of a custom
			delimiter for the output data.
		\item \texttt{-w} \textit{bucket-width} -- Determines the width of the
			histogram bucket. The default value is 1.0.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Summary}
	The program takes a list of numbers, one number per line and builds
	a histogram of the provided distribution. The default bucket width is 1.0,
	but this setting may be overriden with use of the \texttt{-w \textit{width}}
	option.

	The output consists of two columns. The first column is built of the bucket
	center values, whereas in the second columnt the number of the results that
	fell into the according bucket is given. By default the columns are separated
	with the tab character, but this behavior can be altered with use of the
	\texttt{-d \textit{delimiter}} option.

	The program automatically generates empty buckets for the ranges, for which
	there were no results, therefore the data is ready for further processing.
