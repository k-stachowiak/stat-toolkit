%   - The namespaces and the classes
%   - The interface of the relevant classes

\section{Overview}
The libraries, which in this suite take a form of autonomous and atomic C++
header files are the foundation of the entire system. In many cases they are
uniquely tied to one of the command line tools, but others are shared between
the programs. Regardles of the particular use in the suite they are designed to
be as generic as possible and enable potiential use outside of the toolkit.
Therefore their interdependencies are minimized so that in many cases a
particular header file may be simply copied and pasted in another
project\footnote{Note however, that most of them still depends on some of the boost
libraries, so the point is not that they are lightweight, but that they may be
used separately.}.

\chapter{Command Line Interface tools}

% Things that should be found in a cli tool section:
% - List of all options with short descriptions
% - Summary
%   - The explanation of all the concepts (refer to the underlying libraries
%		where possible).
% - Examples

\input{histogram_cli.tex}
\input{aggr_cli.tex}
\input{groupby_cli.tex}
\input{pivot_cli.tex}
